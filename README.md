# credit-risk-classification
20th homework assignment
In this we tested our recent knowledge of supervised learning. We were given loan data to upload and then separate into labels and features. Then we split the data into training and testing datasets using the train_test_split function from sklearn. We then created a Logistic Regression Model using the training data and made predictions. We were able to get a balanced accuracy score of the model and generate a confusion matrix. With this information we made used a classification report to make assumption on the data. We did this all over again but this time created resampled data with a RandomOverSampler module. Using the same steps we were able to get another classification report that, in this instance, gave us better results for our Logistic Regression Model. The code is fairly straight forward and I have continued to enjoy coding in Jupyter Notebook. I do need to revisit the concepts more thoroughly to better understand the benefits and uses of Supervised Learning.
